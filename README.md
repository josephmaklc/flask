## Python Flask app
It is remarkably easy to create a minimalist basic web application with Flask. Anybody with 15 minutes can do this.
See this [Quickstart guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/quickstart/)

First you install it with 
`pip install flask`

Then create a simply py file. Import it, annotate your methods that work like controllers. Create a "templates" folder. HTML in there work like JSP, or Thymeleaf, where you put your html template to be supplied with data from your controller.

Launch with 
`python flaskapp.py`
